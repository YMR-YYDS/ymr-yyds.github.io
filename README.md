## Your Level in WebEditor
Your level is now accessible in the WebEditor page. Please visit [this link](https://hopeh1.github.io/rolling-sky/level-editor/level-recovery/) to recover any level that may have been saved in your LocalStorage. You were warned to regularly back up your level to your device, so consider this as simply a kind gesture from me.
## How do I edit levels now?
I have been asked this question many times in many different ways. You can edit levels in Tiled with the resources in the list and the knowledge that I cannot distribute.
